# SVELTE-FETCH

> A `fetch` client with Svelte store integration for request states.

## Why
When making a web app, I **always** end up adding ongoing requests to some central state array so that I can compute when my application is "loading". That's basically what this is: a thing wrapper around the native `fetch` API, with importable Svelte [`readables`](https://svelte.dev/docs#readable) that can be used to show spinners and blocking modals.

## Install
`npm i -S svelte-fetch` or `yarn add svelte-fetch`

## Usage
```javascript
